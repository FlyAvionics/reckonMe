to configure your Debug, Testing and Production configurations.

### NBULog

Easy to use and easy to extend. Based on [Cocoa Lumberjack](https://github.com/robbiehanson/CocoaLumberjack).

### NBUAdditions

Many useful UIKit and NSFoundation categories that could be useful for many applications.
Import them all or just the ones you need.
